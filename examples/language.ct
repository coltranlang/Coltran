#   - Comments are used to explain code.
#   - Comments are ignored by the interpreter.
# This is a comment.


# ## 2. Variables
#   - A variable is a named location in memory that holds a value.
#   - Variables are declared with the `let` and `final` keywords. 
let var_a = 10 # declare a variable named `a` and assign it a value of `10` . Variables decalred with `let` are mutable.
final var_b = 20 # declare a variable named `b` and assign it a value of `20` . Variables decalred with `final` are immutable.


# ## 3. Strings
#   - Strings are sequences of characters.
#   - Strings are declared with the `"`  or `'` characters.
let string_a = "This is a string" # declare a variable named `string` and assign it a value of the string "This is a string" .
let string_b = 'This is also a string' # declare a variable named `string2` and assign it a value of the string "This is also a string" .

# ## 4. Numbers
# integers
let num_a = 10 # declare a variable named `a` and assign it a value of `10` .
# floats
let num_b = 10.5 # declare a variable named `b` and assign it a value of `10.5` .
# negative numbers
let num_c = -10 # declare a variable named `c` and assign it a value of `-10` .
# hexadecimal numbers
#let num_d = 0xFF # declare a variable named `d` and assign it a value of `0xFF` .
# binary numbers
let num_e = 0b1010 # declare a variable named `e` and assign it a value of `0b1010` .
# octal numbers
#let num_f = 0o777 # declare a variable named `f` and assign it a value of `0o777` .
 
# ## 5. Booleans
#   - Booleans are either `true` or `false`.
#   - Booleans are declared with the `true` or `false` keywords.
let bool_a = true # declare a variable named `a` and assign it a value of `true` .
let bool_b = false # declare a variable named `b` and assign it a value of `false` .


# ## 6. Arrays
#   - Arrays are collections of values.
#   - Arrays are declared with the `[` and `]` characters.
let array_a = [1, 2, 3] # declare a variable named `array` and assign it a value of the array `[1, 2, 3]` .
let array_b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # declare a variable named `array2` and assign it a value of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` .


# ## 7. Pairs
#   - Pairs are collections of values.
#   - Pairs are declared with the `(` and `)` characters.
let pair_a = (1, 2) # declare a variable named `pair` and assign it a value of the pair `(1, 2)` .
let (pair_b, pair_c) = pair_a # declare two variables named `pair_b` and `pair_c` and set them to the values of the pair `pair_a` .


# ## 8. Objects
#   - Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
#   - Objects are declared with the `Object` keyword.
#   - Objects names starting with a capital letter.
#   - Objects don't use comma's after the last key-value pair.
#  - The 'end' keyword is used to end an object.
object Objecta
    name: "Alden"
    type: "Programming Language"
end

# ## 9. function
#   - functions are blocks of code that perform a specific def.
#   - functions are declared with the `def` keyword.
#   - functions names starting with a @ symbol.

def @function_a()
    println("Hello World")
end

def @function_b(user) # declare a def named `function_b` with a parameter named `user` .
    println(f"Hello %{user}")
end


# ## 11. Built-in function
#   - Built-in functions are functions that are automatically available to the user.

#  Built-in functions for printing to the console:
print(@function_a()) # prints "Hello World" to the console.
println(@function_b("Kehinde")) # prints "Hello Kehinde" to the console.

# Built-in functions for input:
#input() # print a prompt to the console and wait for the user to enter a string.
#inputInt() # print a prompt to the console and wait for the user to enter an integer.
#inputFloat() # print a prompt to the console and wait for the user to enter a float.
#inputBool() # print a prompt to the console and wait for the user to enter a boolean.

# Built-in functions for list:
 # returns the length of the array `array_a` .
println(len(array_a)) # prints 3 to the console.
