  <h1>The Official Coltran Programming Language</h1>
</p>

<p>
  Coltran is an open source high-level general-purpose programming language that is designed to be simple, easy to learn, and easy to use to build efficient programs.
</p>

**DISCLAIMER:** This project is in it's very early development state, expect bugs and frequent breaking changes.

## Example
```ruby
class Wallet
    def __@init__(self)
        self.balance = 0
    end
    def deposit(self, amount)
        self.balance += amount
    end
    def withdraw(self, amount)
        if self.balance < amount:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        end
        self.balance -= amount
    end
    def get_balance(self)
        return f"Your balance is $%{self.balance}"
    end
    def str(self)
        return f"Wallet balance: $%{self.balance}"
    end
end
